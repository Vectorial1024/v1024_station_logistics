(links etc)

## Quick Start Guide
This mod is yet another approach to the age-old station-to-station supply-chain problem; see below sections for comparisons with other similar mods.

This mod is actually surprisingly simple:
- Pair player-owned stations together to form (bi-directional) logistics links
- Stations prefer to trade with other paired stations

Transitioning to the endgame has never been easier:
- Extend your trade range using your trade stations
- Intuitively create long-distance supply lines (see examples below)
- Forget the pain of handcrafting Repeat Orders just to move wares
- No need to micro buy/sell prices again
- A worry-free fallback for you in case other custom trading mods fail

For detailed behavioral info (e.g. what this mod does not intend to do), please see Technical Explanation section.
